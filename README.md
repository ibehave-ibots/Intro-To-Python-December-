# Python for Data Analysis and Visualization Workshop

There are three things to do before we start the workshop
1. Install Python via Anaconda
   For python environments.
   Installation instructions: https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/
   Installation verification: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/verify-install/
2. Install Visual Studio Code (Editor)
   Download link: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
   Run the installer and follow the setup wizard
3. Go through First Look Notebook (attached file)
   Make sure you have installed Anaconda and VS Code
   Open the notebook in VS Code
