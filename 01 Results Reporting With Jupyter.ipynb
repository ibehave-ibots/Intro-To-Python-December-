    "Data science notebooks, like Jupyter Notebooks, have changed how researchers do and share their work. These notebooks let you mix code, data, and text in one place. This helps researchers explain their methods and show their results clearly. You can include code, text, equations, charts, and even videos. This makes it easier to share complex ideas with others, like peers, reviewers, and the public.\n",

    "One big benefit of data science notebooks is that they help make research reproducible. Reproducibility means that others can repeat your work and get the same results. Notebooks save the whole process of your analysis, from data cleaning to final results. By sharing the notebook, you give others everything they need to repeat your study, including the exact code and outputs. This builds trust in your findings and helps others build on your work.\n",

    "  - `seaborn`: Makes it simple to make plots from pandas tables,\n",
